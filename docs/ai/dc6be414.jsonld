  "description": "Lookal is a community-first, peer-to-peer rental marketplace designed for everyday Filipinos seeking affordable housing solutions. It serves students, OFW families, young professionals, and small landlords by connecting tenants directly with property owners, eliminating middlemen and broker fees. The platform prioritizes trust and safety through verified landlords, multi-category reviews, and a built-in chat system, operating as a digital barangay bulletin board for the Philippines. Lookal is not a luxury condo portal or a real estate brokerage, but a technology platform facilitating connections and providing essential tools for a trusted rental experience.",
